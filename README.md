> [!NOTE]  
> These controls won't be configurable, so please don't bother opening issue and requesting for feature to add such option. If you're using keyboard with missing key consider using autohotkey or some other software to "rebind" the key.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you're using controller and it doesn't work in normal game it won't work for Mod Menu itself. The menu is handling input same way as the game does it, so if you're having issue with controller itself try using [GangstaPatch](https://github.com/GangstaTeam/GangstaPatch), if that didn't work then consider opening issue on the GangstaPatch GitHub as it's Patch of our team.
